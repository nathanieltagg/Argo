Notes on mongodb schema:

Each experiment gets it's own DB.
Each project on an experiment gets it's own collection.

Each document should have a type
  'type': 'scan'  -> The data from a user's hand-scan attempt
  'type': 'scanform' -> The HTML document describing an empty hand-scan form
  'type': 'inbox'  -> An inbox entry for a user
  'type': 'event' -> An interesting event in a list

A scan document:  
{
  type: 'scan',
  event_id: { ... elements uniquely describing this event ...},
  checksum: { ... data checking event integrity: odhits, idhits, etc ...}
  scan_id: { user_name: "Anonymous Coward", modification_date: <date> }
  scan: { ... form data... }
} 

A scanform document:
{
  type: 'scanform',
  scanform: <html>
}
Will use the ObjectId _id to sort the scanform documents, choosing only the most recent.


An inbox document:
{
  type: 'inbox',
  user_name: "Anonymous Coward",
  event_id: { ... enough to load this event ...}
}

A bookmarked event:
{
  type: 'event',
  label: 'nice event', -> optional label for presenting event.
  event_id: { ... enough to load this event ...}
  user_name: "Anonymous Coward" -> optional
}
