This project is the Argo online web-based event display for the 
MicroBooNE neutrino experiment.

This code was written by Nathaniel Tagg (ntagg@otterbein.edu) and our group at Otterbein University, 
with the exception of some third-party libraries (mostly in the js/ directory). 
Other authors and contributors include Phillip Kellogg, Curtis Brown, Molly Clairemont, 
Jack Brangham, and Erin Cochran.

This code can only be used with permission of the maintainer, who takes no responsibility
for it being readable, sensible, or any proclivity for it to summon Ancient Old Ones 
to destroy humanity. Your Sanity May Be At Risk.  Abandon all hope, yadda yadda yadda.

If you use this work for your own projects, you are required to put attribution to us somewhere
on your main page.


Work on this project is based off of the Arachne event display for Minerva, by the same authors.
A technical paper describing the operation of this system was published in 
Nucl.Inst.Meth. 676 (2012) 44-49, and is available on the arXiv at http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5315
