Quick instructions for installing a new copy so that it will load.

Make sure apache is running correctly.

Make sure apache is configured correctly.  Either DocumentRoot or the userdir configuration 
will need:
	    AllowOverride All
in the options set, so that the local .htaccess files can set up rewriting and librares.
Might also need to turn on/install rewrite_module.

Install requisite perl modules (CGI, JSON::XS, a few others)

Find a built copy of root.
$ ln -sf $ROOTSYS backend/root
$ cd backend; make; cd -
$ chmod a+w datacache/ server/
$ cp dot.htaccess .htaccess
Edit the .htaccess file, using YOUR absolute link for RewriteBase
$ cp datacache/dot.htaccess datacache/.htaccess
Edit above, ditto

Try a load. Might take two or three reloads to get backend going
