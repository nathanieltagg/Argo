First, you'll need to download an installation of larsoft.
You need larsoftobj version v08_01_01 or later, ideally with the c2 compiler.
You'll also need the uboondaq_datatypes v6_22_05a

Then, edit backend/setup.sh using one of the templates.  Source this file. You'll need to source it every time you run.

$ cd libargo
$ make
$ cd ..
$ npm install

This should download all 3rd party packages and install the patch code.

To run:
$ node index.js

And point your browser at localhost:4590
