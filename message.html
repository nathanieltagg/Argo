      Apparently, Argo was removed from use in the control room some months ago.  I have no idea why - no one talked to me about it.

    <p> I've also just learned this site is inaccessible from the wireless at Fermilab, which is strange, but lends credibility to the idea no one actually uses this.
    </p>
    <p> So, I'm going to demand user feedback - contact me at my email address to get access to this site. </p>
